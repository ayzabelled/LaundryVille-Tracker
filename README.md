## 🏃‍♀️ How to Run 🏃‍♂️

2.  Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/ayzabelled/LaundryVille-Tracker.git` 
3.  Open the project folder: `cd LaundryVille-Tracker`

    *   Create a new project and database instance.
    *   Neon will provide you with a connection string (something like `postgres://user:password@host:port/database`).  This is your `DATABASE_URL`!  **Keep this secret!**
